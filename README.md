# NIM
[Nim is a mathematical game of strategy in which two players take turns removing objects from distinct heaps. On each turn, a player must remove at least one object, and may remove any number of objects provided they all come from the same heap. The goal of the game is to avoid being the player who must remove the last object.][1]

This is an implementation of the same game as a WebApplication for the class of Web Technologies
A server was also built using nodejs and can be seen [here](https://github.com/andreluis034/nim-server)
